Hawaii Climate Analysis API

Overview

This project includes two major parts: a data analysis section using Python and Pandas, and a Flask web application providing an API for climate data from Hawaii. The data analysis part explores temperature and precipitation trends, while the Flask app makes this data accessible through a web interface.

Data Analysis
- Utilized Pandas for detailed climate data analysis.
- Analyzed temperature trends and precipitation data.
- Visualized data using Matplotlib for a clearer understanding of climate patterns.

Flask Web Application
- Provides an API to access analyzed climate data.

Access
- Jupyter Notebooks can be viewed for data analysis insights.
- Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ after running the Flask app.
